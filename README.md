## Introduction
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive analysis project focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. The project includes detailed Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the application of PCA to reduce dimensionality of datasets, followed by the use of clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups within the data. Through insightful visualizations and code, the project aims to provide a deep understanding of these powerful data analysis methods.

## Dependencies
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
